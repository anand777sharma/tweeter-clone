I began the backend development of this project by defining the models.
Initially,
I created two models:
User and Tweet, represented by :
1. User.js
2. Tweet.js

I proceeded to establish the routes for the web application.
........................................................... 
These routes were organized into four main categories:
auth_route, file_route, tweet_route, and user_route.js.

In the auth_route, I implemented the following endpoints:
---------------------------------------------------------
router.post('/register', register);
router.post('/login', login);
=========================================================

Moving on to the file_route, the endpoints were defined as:
...........................................................
router.post("/uploadFile", upload.single('file'), sendfilename);
router.get("/files/:filename", downloadFile);
===========================================================

n the tweet_route, I structured the endpoints as follows:
.........................................................
router.post('/', authenticate, createtweet); // Create tweet
router.put('/:id/like', authenticate, liketweet); // Like tweet
router.put('/:id/dislike', authenticate, disliketweet); // Dislike tweet
router.post('/:id/reply', authenticate, replytweet); // Reply to tweet
router.get('/:id', gettweetbyid); // Get single tweet detail
router.get('/', getalltweet); // Get all tweet detail
router.delete('/:id', authenticate, deletetweet); // Delete tweet
router.put('/:id/retweet', authenticate, retweet); // Retweet
==========================================================

Lastly, in the user_route, the endpoints were structured as follows:
....................................................................
router.get('/:id', getuserbyid); // Get user by id
router.get("/", getalluser); // Get all users
router.put("/:id", authenticate, updateuserbyid); // Update user by id
router.put("/:id/follow", authenticate, followuser); // Follow user
router.put("/:id/unfollow", authenticate, unfollowuser); // Unfollow user
router.get("/:id/tweets", getusertweets); // Get user tweets
router.get("/:id/retweets", getuserretweets); // Get user retweets
router.post("/:id/uploadprofilepic", authenticate, uploadprofilepic); // Upload profile pic
===================================================================================

Subsequently, I created all the necessary controllers and middleware to handle these routes effectively.
===================================================================================

In the frontend part, React is utilized along with Axios for data fetching and sending requests to the backend. Bootstrap is employed for styling, while React Toastify is utilized for displaying responses and messages from the backend. The components in the frontend are structured as follows:

1. Floating Modals:
   - CreateTweetModal.js
   - EditProfileModal.js
   - ReplyTweetModal.js

2. Spinner

3. Components:
   - Profile.js
   - Sidebar.js
   - Topbar.js
   - TweetCard.js
   - TweetDetail.js
   - TweetList.js

4. Pages:
   - Home.js
   - Login.js
   - OtherProfile.js
   - Signup.js
   - Tweet.js
   - UserProfile.js

All these components and pages are then rendered in the App.js file.
This systematic structuring ensures a clear separation of concerns 
and facilitates easier maintenance and scalability of the application.

i have deleted node_module files for both backend and frontend before project submission so please 
Run command "npm inatall" and then "npm start" for both backend and frontend.

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges arising
from the absence of doubt-solving sessions and lack of discussions regarding the 
Twitter clone project. Consequently, I may have misunderstood certain project requirements.
I sincerely apologize for any errors or misinterpretations that may have occurred as a result.
